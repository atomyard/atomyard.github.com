We are pleased to announce our new Shopify App, [Local Delivery](https://apps.shopify.com/local-delivery-1), which was developed in late 2012 with the assistance of the Shopify Fund. The app is designed to help small businesses such as bakeries or florists manage deliveries in their local area.

The app adds a delivery time and date request form to your cart page. Customers can then request a time and date when they would like their orders delivered.

<br>
<b>Selected Features:</b>

+ *Delivery Hours* - Specify available delivery days and times for your store.

+ *Blackout Specific Days* - Set days where delivery is not available.

+ *Set Delivery Rate Limits* - Limit the number of deliveries in a given time period.

+ *Manage Orders* - View all pending and past deliveries at a glance. This allows you to keep track of what deliveries need to take place and to mark them off when they are completed.  

<br>
The app has a free 14 day trial period and can be found on the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/local-delivery-1).   

If you have any questions or need installation help, contact us here: [support@atomyard.com](mailto:support@atomyard.com). We are more than happy to help!
