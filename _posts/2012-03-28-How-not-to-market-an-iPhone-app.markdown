title: How not to market an iPhone app
---
As a long time reader of Hacker News, I've read countless posts, blogs and books about starting a startup. I thought I'd gained a lot of knowledge from them. Concepts such as scratching your own itch, minimum viable product, feedback and iterate all sounded great.

So after much procrastination, I finally decided to take the plunge and make something. I thought I'd apply these ideas and victory would be mine!

**Scratch your own itch**  
I'm always thinking of ideas for startups and products. I used to write these down on the standard iPhone Notes app but after a while I realized that I had dozens of ideas that I had dreamed up which I never looked at again. I wanted a way to be reminded of these ideas without having to read through them all every few weeks, so I decided to make an app that would remind me about one of my ideas each day.

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**  
I thought long and hard about what was the simplest app that could satisfy my needs and began to make it. It was difficult at first, to resist the urge to add extra features such as cloud syncing, sharing via Facebook/Twitter, picture notes, a fancy interface, etc. I didn't even know if my app had enough features for people to find useful but I stuck with the MVP principle anyway.

**Feedback and iterate**  
I told myself that even if I didn't get it right at first, at least I'd get feedback about what users actually wanted from my app. Which is what the books say right? So I bit the bullet and released [Noted!](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noted!/id504164257?ls=1&mt=8). It was pretty agonising to have to wait two days for iTunes connect to update with my sales results. I didn't expect anything major, but I hoped that at least a few people might buy it. 

**Initial sales results**  
First day - two sales. It was better than zero, but not great considering one of the sales was to a friend of mine. Maybe the next day would bring better results? Nope. A string of days with zero sales. How could I iterate if I didn't get any feedback? This isn't how it was in the books. 

**Marketing**  
As sales were slow, I decided I needed to do some marketing. I had access to a 500+ user Facebook group so I posted a link to my app there. Several days later, still zero sales. It was a long shot and it turns out marketing to a fairly random group of people is not much use. I really needed to target a specific audience.

By chance, I happened to be reading a Hacker News post and in the comments someone [asked](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3714531) if anyone had a good way to help record ideas. What great luck! So I replied with a link to my web site. I got 12 hits on my website and 2 sales in about 24 hours. A good conversion ratio but sales were back to zero the next day.

**Make it free!**  
I really needed some feedback - just a few users to let me know if they found it useful, or hated it or anything! I decided that the best way to get my initial users was to offer the app for free for 48 hours and then maybe I might get some feedback. After it went gratis, I had 859 downloads in the 48 hour period. Surely now someone would let me know what they thought of the app. Nope. Perhaps the higher ranking on the app store would translate into sales when the app went back to paid. No such luck. I did get one paid sale immediately after the free period but then it was back to zero. 

**The final score**  
Four weeks on the app store, 859 free sales, 9 paid and I'm still none the wiser. Is this typical of iPhone apps? Was the app bad? Was it the marketing? Was it both? I still don't know the answers but I intend to find out.
