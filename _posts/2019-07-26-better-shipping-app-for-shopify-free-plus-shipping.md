#### with the Better Shipping App for Shopify
<br>
Free + Shipping has proven to be a really popular tool for lots of merchants as it allows you to offer customers the attraction of “free products” yet still remain profitable. The [Better Shipping App for Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/better-shipping) allows you to set this up quickly and easily! It also allows you to offer a multitude of other shipping promotions (eg free shipping on orders over $50) while still retaining the shipping costs of your free products. 

You can use the per product shipping rates feature to set up your per product rates for your free + shipping products. If you also want to make sure that those products are excluded from your shipping rules, click the “skip shipping rules” column.

This one simple step will ensure that your free + shipping products will still generate shipping fees even if you have other “free shipping” rules set up in the app.
